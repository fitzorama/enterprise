## Coding a new Component Checklist

- See if it can be done with only css.
- Add _*.scss file to sass/controls folder similar to current examples
- Add new entry for new file in _controls.scss
- Add any variables in _config.scss
- Add a view like current examples to views/controls
- Add link to view to index.html page
- if js is needed copy the template.js in the js/controls folder.
- modify the gruntfie.js to add the new script
- add initializer code to initialize.js (should be able to boot strap the page)
- code control
- write unit tests
- make sure all tests pass
- run grunt to test eslint for the new control
- verify html is valid: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html-validator/>
- verify no automated accessibility errors <http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/>
- test your page with voice over <https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/>
- test your page with Jaws (download <http://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/ProductDemos>) <http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/learn/accessible/atc/quickstarts/jaws-2/>
- commit and pull request
- close jira and quote the Jira number on the commit message
- document on the cms site

## QA Documentation

Test Page:
<http://usalvlhlpool1.infor.com/4.4.0-rc/components>
(Note that each control can be accessed on its own url `http://usalvlhlpool1.infor.com/4.4.0-rc/components/<name>` for example:
`<http://usalvlhlpool1.infor.com/4.4.0-rc/components/slider)`

### Things to Test

The controls should be tested in several ways:

- Browser Testing - IE11, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, IOS  (Phone and Tablet), Android (Phone and Tablet), Windows Touch (Surface)
- Touch Device Support Testing
- Accessibility Testing according to [WCAG Accessibility Standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
- Developer Testing - Can the Controls be easily coded from the documentation, developer Web Driver.IO tests ect.
- Testing against requirements

### Related Testing Tools

- Tester can grab latest code from github (Generally One Month Cycles for versions/QA).
- tester would go through every Html page example opening it in:  IE11, Edge Firefox, Safari, Chrome, IOS  (Phone and Tablet), Android (Phone and Tablet), Windows Touch (Surface)
- Cross check designs with <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z9mmUZJlAqkCLy8vyie3AjRKUR4SVKuHGyFiQiGm98A/edit?pli=1#gid=989468169>
- Tests for Accessibility
    1. Run Wave Toolbar <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh/related> and <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-toolbar/>
    1. Run Squizz â€“ Html Sniffer <http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/>
    1. Test for Keyboard against <http://access.aol.com/dhtml-style-guide-working-group/>
    1. Test with screen readers (voice over, nvda and jaws), If only one Jaws is most critical
     [Jaws](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS) can be downloaded and used for 40 minutes before a reboot. It runs on windows and works best on newer IE browsers. This is the primary screen reader to learn and test.
     Secondary Screen readers are [Voice over](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/) for use on IOS and Mac and [NVDA](http://www.nvaccess.org/) for use in windows Firefox.
- Any issues or inconsistencies would be reported to <http://jira.infor.com/browse/HFC>
- Create Selenium (Javascript based) scripts or similar tests (see tests folder in git project)
- Help contribute to questions on Jira and make test examples to test different scenarios like the current test examples.
